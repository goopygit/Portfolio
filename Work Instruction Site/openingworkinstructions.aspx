            <h2>Opening Process</h2>

            Before opening a new package, always ensure that no items have been left on the opening table from a previous package. If an item is left out of a package, it must be immediately reported to a lead/supervisor. Do not save it for later or wait.


            <br> It is <b>never acceptable</b> to have more than one package on the table at a time.

            <br> There are designated spaces on each opening table for the box/envelope, packing material, paperwork, units, and accessories. These must be adhered to as you open, and you will be expected to do so when being audited. This is to prevent
            mixing up products, leaving items out, throwing away accessories, etc. These issues are significant consumer-facing issues that you are directly responsible for preventing.

            <br> The manner of packaging we receive from consumers varies greatly. You are expected to exercise good judgment in opening with the highest level of care to preserve the condition of the products.
            <br> It is best practice to open the package and remove the contents before cutting the UPS label off in order to reduce the risk of cutting the contents. This may not be possible in every scenario, as the label may cover the opening of the
            box or envelope.
            <br> Reduce the amount of exposed blade, so there is just enough to cut the seal of the package. Using more exposed blade increases the risk of causing damage to the contents of the package.
            <br> As you unpack the items, place them in the designated spaces on the desk.
            <br> If the items are inside of plastic bags, wrapped in bubble wrap, or plastic wrap, carefully remove the items and dispose of the wrapping.
            <br> Any packing material, such as crumpled newspaper, must be <b>thoroughly</b> searched for any loose items. SD Cards and Game Cards are very small, and can easily become lost in the excess packing material. It is your responsibility to
            prevent these items from being overlooked before disposing of it.
            <br> Retail packaging, towels, or old t-shirts are sometimes used as packing material. We are not obligated to return these items to the consumer.
            <br> If packaging is damaged/open/empty upon arrival, do NOT dispose of the package. Bring the package to a lead/supervisor, so that we may start a damaged package investigation with UPS.
            <br> As you pull out consumer letters, quickly identify whether or not they included a packing list. If there are items on the list, ensure that they are present in the packaging and that you haven't overlooked them. If any items are missing,
            bring this to the attention of a lead/supervisor.
            <br> Remove the shipping label including the return address from the packaging, and write your initials in legibly the white space. Take care not to cut off any consumer information, such as the name, house number, street name, etc.
            <br> If there are any extra shipping labels or consumer information on the package, such as in the case that the package was reused, it is our responsibility to remove <b>all privacy related information from the package.
            <br> If they do not appear to be relevant to the consumer who sent the repair to us, be sure to remove it from the packaging and include it in the new package, but <u>cross out the irrelevant consumer information.</u></b>

            <h2>Re-Packaging</h2>
            Before re-boxing, some items need to be put in bubble bags or foam bags to protect them from damage in handling.
            <ul>
                <li>Each joycon must be placed inside of a small bubble bag.</li>
                <li>Each 3DS console, HAC console, or HDH console must be placed inside of a foam bag.</li>
                <li>These are rare, but WiiU Consoles and Game Pads must be placed into a large bubble bag.</li>
                <li>Other accessories such as cables/chargers may be loose in the box.</li>
                <li>Game Cards and other small items should be affixed to the top of the inside of the box inside of a UPS bag.</li>
            </ul>
            Depending on the items contained in the package, we must rebox them accordingly along with <u>all</u> of the corresponding paperwork, letters, shipping labels, etc.:
            <ul>
                <li>If there are only JoyCons in a package, place them inside of the small sized box.
                    <br>The Small Box can fit up to 4 joycons. Do not include more than 4 joycons in this box </li>
                <li>There is a medium-sized box which is sometimes used in place of the small sized box, for joycon-only ROs, HDH consoles, or 3DS consoles.
                    <br>The medium-sized box can fit up to 6 joycons, or 1 3DS/HDH console. If the HDH console includes accessories, use a larger box than this.</li>
                <li>The larger sized box should primarily be used for HAC consoles with accessories. Occasionally, we receive a WiiU Console or gamepad which should also be packaged in the large box.</li>
                <li>On rare occasions, we may receive a WiiU Console with a Gamepad. These should be packaged in the extra-large "Overpack" box.</li>
            </ul>
        </p1>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            Place the repackaged repair in the appropriate cart to be staged for Receiving. JoyCon-only ROs should be separate from Console/3DS/WiiU orders. Once again, ensure that your opening bench is empty and that no items or paperwork have been left out.
