            <br> There is a 5 digit number on the work order tag. Ensure that this number matches the last 5 digits of the serial number of the console you have inside of the box <b>before</b> performing the repair. A mismatch is a failure, and should
            be brought to the attention of a lead/supervisor immediately.

            Occasionally, we will receive an order on behalf of Best Buy. 
            <br>In these cases, a consumer name and address will not be present in the box. If you receive a best buy order and there is a specific customer name or address, <b>please inform a supervisor.</b> 
            <br>There may be a best buy invoice/order paper in the box. It is not necessary, but please ensure it does not conflict with the order number/address referenced on the shipping label.
            <br>Instead, the first name on the shipping label will be "BestBuy" and the last name will be the Best Buy order number.
            <br>It is permitted in these cases to receive this as you would any other order. That said, be certain that any Best Buy orders do not have any extra paperwork that does not match the Best Buy paperwork.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            Repair/Assembly is very much a "hands-on" position. As such, we won't cover every detail of assembly here. That said, there are many handling guidelines and precautions that are essential to this position.
            <br> When performing the responsibilities of the job, all of these handling guidelines <b>must be followed.</b>
            <br> We'll begin by going over these guidelines, and then go over the general expectations of you as a repair technician.

            <h2>Repair Process Guidelines</h2>
            <br> The traveler reads from left to right, and you are meant to replace the parts designated in the "Triage" column. A few steps you are required to perform for each part that you replace are detailed in the repair column.
            <br> You only need to perform the steps that correspond to each part that you replace.
            <br> All parts which were assigned at Triage should already be in the box, with the exception of a Main PCB. To get a new Main PCB, you must first remove the defective one, label it with the RO, and bring it to the parts department to be replaced.
            <br> All PCBs must be damaged according to <a href="https://nintendo.sharepoint.com/sites/techsvc/NX/Shared%20Documents/NOA-62-0125-001.pdf#page=4" target="_blank">NOA's guidelines</a> prior to returning them to parts department.
            <br> Any parts you are signing out from the window, including a Main PCB, must be written on the back of the traveler prior to signing them out. If you need a part number reference, ask a lead/supervisor.
            <br> Some parts, such as foam sheets, USB-C ports, screws, are signed out in bulk via the "Bench Stock form". Fill out one form for each part number you need. The quantity for screws may need to be determined by the parts department attendant,
            depending on how they are packaged. All other parts must be assigned to the specific RO for which they are being installed.
            <br> The assembly guidelines are located <a href="https://nintendo.sharepoint.com/sites/techsvc/NX/Shared%20Documents/HAC-62-0032-001.pdf" target="_blank">here for HAC/HAD,</a> and <a href="https://nintendo.sharepoint.com/sites/techsvc/NX/Shared%20Documents/HDH-62-0020-001.pdf"
                target="_blank">here for HDH.</a>
            <br> Always follow correct torque values for screw installation. This is critically important and you will be audited to ensure you are following it.
            <br> Never use metal tools in handling electronic components.
            <br> Review the handling precautions in <a href="https://nintendo.sharepoint.com/sites/techsvc/NX/Shared%20Documents/HAC-62-0033-001.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Section 5 of this document.</a>
            <br> You should rarely, if ever, have extra parts, but if a part is not needed for some reason, <b>it must be returned to the parts department before passing the unit on.</b>
            <br> All parts from a disassembled unit must be placed separately on the work bench. Do not "stack" parts, as this may cause damage.
            <br> Whenever you have disassembled a console, write a large "B" on the traveler. This can be written in any empty space to the right side of the traveler, or in the empty testing column in the center of the work order.
    </div>
    <div class="rightSection" id="defectiveparthandling">
        <p1>
            <h2>Defective Part Handling</h2>
            All defective parts must be marked with a red marker <b>prior to being removed from the unit.</b>
            <br>All defective parts must be marked as defective and stored separately from good parts. This means that defective parts must <b>never be stored on the bench.</b> There are red bins at each bench which are specifically designated for defective
            parts.
            <br>Main PCBs must be damaged according to NOA guidelines.
            <br>Only new screws may be installed in exterior components of the console. Old screws must be stored separately from new screws.
            <br>If you install a new part which is seemingly defective, it must be returned to the parts department with a DFS form.

            <div style="color:red"><b>All PCB and battery replacements require battery lot information to be registered. The following steps must be performed while the unit is disassembled, so that the barcode on the battery is visible.</b></div>
            First, follow the instructions in <a href="https://nintendo.sharepoint.com/sites/techsvc/NX/Shared%20Documents/HAC-62-0146-001.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">this document.</a>
            <br>Next, fill out the form located at <a href="galaxyprd.unitedradio.com/batterylotnumber" target="_blank">galaxyprd.unitedradio.com/batterylotnumber</a>
            <br> Begin by scanning the RO number.
            <br> If you are replacing a main PCB and not a battery, scan the barcode on the battery as both the "Old Lot Number" and "New Lot Number".
            <br> If you are replacing the battery, scan the original battery as the "Old Lot Number" and the new battery as the "New Lot Number."
            <br>Click Save Lot Number, then Print label. The label must be affixed to the traveler in the designated location.
            <br>You may delete the lot number and perform this process again if necessary.

            <h2>Analog Module Identification (HDH Only)</h2>
            Follow the instructions detailed <a href="https://nintendo.sharepoint.com/sites/techsvc/NX/Pages/HDH.aspx#parts" target="_blank">on sharepoint</a> to identify whether the analog module is H1/H3/Fit.
            <br> This <u>must</u> be noted on the traveler for HDH units, as the information is required to perform testing and calibration.
            <br> Neglecting to do this will result in a failure.
        </p1>
    </div>

    <div class="rightSection" id="ESD">
        <p1>
            <h2>ESD Handling Precautions</h2>
            <br> Always follow correct ESD Handling procedures to prevent damage to sensitive internal components. There are absolutely no exceptions to these guidelines. <span style="color:red"><b>The wrist strap must be worn at all times, and it must be plugged in to the ESD monitor. Do not use the "GUEST" side, as this circumvents the monitoring functionality. The wrist strap must be worn when you are at the "goop station" (the thermal putty dispensor), at the USB-C solder station, in the clean air booth, and the repair bench.</b></span>
            <div style="color:red"><b>If you find that your ESD monitor is constantly beeping, this likely means that your wrist strap is loose. All lights on the ESD monitor must be green when the wrist strap is being worn.</b></div>
            <br> The ESD Monitor may beep while the AC Adapter is plugged in to the console you are holding. This is not abnormal, since the AC adaptor is not grounded. For this reason, <span style="color:red"><b><u>you must never test or plug the console in while the unit is disassembled. At a minimum, the lower frame of the unit must be on in order to prevent static damage to the console.</u></b></span>
            <br>The humidifier must be running at all times. If you are experiencing issues with the humidifier, notify a lead/supervisor immediately. Often, issues with leaking/vapor not dispensing can be resolved by emptying the humidifier, drying it
            out, and refilling it. These issues are often prompted a fluctuation in pressure usually caused by the humidifier tipping over, the bottle being loose, or there being simply too much water in the reservoir.
            <br> When you are carrying a disassembled unit away from the grounded workstation, such as when you are performing battery lot registration, you must carry the unit and all loose electronic parts inside of NOA-approved static-safe containers
            such as the cardboard box, or ESD bags.
            <br> TPGC and MicroSD PCBs are particularly fragile in Nintendo's eyes, due to the "B2B" connector. These parts must be stored inside of an ESD safe bag.
            <br>Nintendo's complete ESD guidelines are outlined <a href="https://nintendo.sharepoint.com/sites/techsvc/NX/Shared%20Documents/HAC-62-0033-001.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">here.</a>
