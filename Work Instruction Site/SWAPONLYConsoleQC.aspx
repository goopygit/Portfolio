            &#9657; <u>All</u> operators must be wearing gloves.
            <br> &#9657; <u>All</u> benches must have scratch protection in the form of either pink foam or the ESD mat.
            <br> &#9657; <u>All</u> operators must follow one piece flow, meaning there is only one repair order on the bench at a time.<br>
            <div style="color:red"><u><b>There are no exceptions to these rules. If there is a preventative, inform a lead or supervisor immediately.</b></u></div>
            <br> &#9657; All proprietary test software must be treated with the utmost level of care. These are property of Nintendo of America and are strictly controlled.
            <div style="color:red"><b>Each item is serialized and inventoried at the beginning and end of every shift. Do <b><u>NOT</u></b> lose track of these items. If an item goes missing, immediately notify a lead or supervisor so that it may be located as soon as possible.

            <br> &#9657; All items in the box must correspond to the items received on the work order tag and written on the traveler.<br>
            <div style="color:red"><b>If any items do not match completely, are

            <br> &#9657; The traveler must be filled out for all preceding positions. QC is the last station to fill out the traveler. Triage and Restore should <b>always</b> be filled out. Repair and Testing may be blank if the unit was exchanged or
            only accessories were repaired/exchanged, but this is the only exception. Any paperwork which is incomplete is an indicator that not all processes were performed, and is considered a failure.

        <h2>QC Process</h2>
        <p1>
            After all consumer information and components have been verified, begin by reading the consumer's reported symptom. If the consumer included a letter or note, read that as well. This will indicate the reason that the consumer sent the unit in for repair.
            It is QC's responsibility to perform a practical test to ensure that the consumer's reported symptom (CRS) has been resolved. There are a few other routine tests and checks that we perform as well, but this is the primary function of QC. The
            following steps may be performed in no particular order, and the efficiency of the sequence may vary based on symptom. Nevertheless, <b>all</b> of the following steps must be performed before completing QC.

            <h3>CRS Resolved</h3>
            As all HAC/HAD consoles are being exchanged, we will presume all consoles to be in satisfactory functional condition. As such, CRS verification is not necessary.
            <h3>Int/Ext Serial Number Match, Menu Up to Date, Frame Rate Test</h3>
            As all HAC/HAD consoles are being exchanged, we will presume all consoles to be in satisfactory functional condition. These functional checks are not necessary.
            <h3>Visual Inspection</h3>
            As all HAC/HAD consoles are being exchanged, we will presume all consoles to be in satisfactory physical condition. A full visual inspection is not necessary.
            <h3>Test/Replace/Pack Accessories</h3>
            Under Swap-Only process, all accessories should have been replaced, with the exception of the AC Adapter, Dock, and Game Cards. These accessories should be replaced on an as-needed basis. That said, if you receive any accessories in the box which are
            labeled with the RO number, it likely needs replacement and was overlooked.
            <br> There is no need to test the new item, but the QC operator's responsibility to package them in a manner presentable to the consumer.
            <br> It is necessary to affix a "3 Language Label" to every foam bag in a box which contains a swap.
            <br>Neatly and carefully wrap each cable with a twist tie, and place each accessory into its' own individual plastic bag. If there are numerous accessories, consolidate them into one large plastic bag, but they must be wrapped individually
            as well. It is not necessary to consolidate the dock or joycons, as packing them too tightly can cause damage, and may prove difficult in the final shipping stages.
            <br>Game Cards may be included in a UPS bag affixed to the top of the inside of the box. Be sure to seal this bag before passing the RO.
            <br>Consumer-owned SD cards, (not to be confused with Backup SD cards), must be inserted into the HAC console prior to passing the RO.
            <h3>Nickname Verification</h3>
            Power on the unit with no test card present, so that you boot into the typical system menu. From the main menu, select the user profile in the upper left of the screen. They may have more than one user, but we are primarily concerned with the left-most
            profile. Ensure that this matches what was written on the work order in the top left corner of the traveler and mark the box labeled "User Name Verified". If it does not match, process the RO as a discrepancy.
            <h3>SD Match/Card Removed</h3>
            <div><b>This step <u>must</u> be performed last. That way, if the unit fails for any reason, there is no risk of losing the consumer's save data.</b></div>
            This last step is simple, but important. If the unit has a backup SD card inside of it, ensure that the last 3 digits of the SD serial number match what was written on the traveler in backup and restore, remove the SD card from the box, and mark the box
            labeled "SD Match/Card Removed". Each QC station has a bin to deposit the backup SD cards into after QC is completed. If there is no backup card, this step is not necessary. If it does not match, process the RO as a discrepancy.
        </p1>

        <h2>Cleaning the Console</h2>
        <p1>
            Prior to passing QC, we are required to gently clean/wipe the HAC console with a mixture of alcohol and water AND ammonia-free Windex, in that order.
            <ul>
                <li>First, clean the surface of the unit with the alcohol/water mixture using a microfiber towel.
                    <div style="color:red"><b>Do not use excessive alcohol, as this can cause damage to the unit. A single dab on the towel is likely sufficient.</b></div>
                </li>
                <li>Wait for the unit to dry, which should only take a few moments since alcohol quickly evaporates. Alternatively, you can use a <u><b>separate</b></u> dry microfiber towel. </li>
                <li><span style="color:red"><b>Using a separate microfiber towel,</span> wipe the surface of the unit with Ammonia-Free Windex only. Blue windex is not Ammonia-Free, and is not acceptable per Nintendo of America.</b>
                </li>
            </ul>

                Conclusion
            </h2>
            After cleaning the unit, performing all tests, cleaning and wrapping all accessories, QC is complete. This concludes the QC process work instructions.
