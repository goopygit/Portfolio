            - <u>All</u> operators must be wearing gloves.
            <br> - <u>All</u> benches must have scratch protection in the form of either pink foam or the ESD mat.
            <br> - <u>All</u> operators must follow one piece flow, meaning there is only one repair order/box on the bench at a time.<br>

        <div style="color:red"><b>The operator should validate <u><i>all</i></u> information and components.</b></div> <br> - Each RO on the box label should correspond to a work order in the box.

        <h2>Write-Up Entry</h2>
        <p1>
            - If there is more than one RO in a box, start by linking all of them together using the "Link Sister ROs" function at the top of the form.
            <br>
            <img src="./original (old)/writeupworkinstructions_files/writeupref6.PNG" alt="RO Validation" style="height:300px">
            <br> **If you need to link more than 2 ROs, you can click "Add New Sister" after filling out each box in order to add one more. You may add up to 8.

            <br> - After linking any ROs together that need to be linked, begin the writeup process by entering an RO into the "RO Number" field and clicking Verify. This can be done in any order.
            <br><img src="./original (old)/writeupworkinstructions_files/writeupro.PNG" alt="RO Validation" style="height:200px">
            <br> -The consumer's name and address information will populate on the writeup form. Once again, compare this information with what you have on the work order to ensure you are working on the correct consumer:
            <br><img src="./original (old)/writeupworkinstructions_files/writeupaddress.jpg" alt="RO Validation" style="height:200px">
            <br><img src="./original (old)/writeupworkinstructions_files/writeupref3.PNG" alt="RO Validation" style="width:auto;height:auto">
            <br> - For the "Tech Initial" field: enter your own initials.
            <br> - For the Additional Repair Charge question - Enter Yes if the unit required disassembly. This should be indicated with a 'B' on the traveler. If you are in doubt, analyze the traveler to assess whether or not internal parts were replaced.
            In other words, if any boxes which were not "Swap" are checked under the repair column, the answer should be yes.
            <li>We should view the Part Usage page to validate that a repair has taken place, and/or that a swap was appropriately assigned to the RO. To the right of the page, click "Part Usage". If repair parts were assigned, we should bill an additional
                charge. If the traveler is marked Swap, we should verify that a swap is present.</li>
            <br> - For the "Repair Initial" field: enter the initials from the traveler. In the case of a swap, the traveler may be blank, and this should be N/A.
            <br> - For the "Testing Initial" field: enter the initials from the traveler. In the case of a swap, the traveler may be blank, and this should be N/A.
            <br> - For the "Data Transfer Initial" field: For a JoyCon-Only RO, this should always be NA.
            <br> - For the "QC Initial" field: enter the initials written on the traveler. All units should be QCed, so this should never be blank.
            <br><img src="./original (old)/writeupworkinstructions_files/writeupqc.jpg" alt="RO Validation" style="width:auto;height:200px">
            <br> -For the "Notes" field: This is often not necessary for JoyCon-Only ROs.
            <br> - Shipping Code is automatically handled by the computer, but you should validate that it is correct by looking at the traveler:
            <br><img src="./original (old)/writeupworkinstructions_files/shipping method.jpg" alt="RO Validation" style="width:auto;height:100%">
            <br> All items should ship out via 2 Day or faster until further notice. Even though the traveler says Ground, the computer has automatically upgraded it to 2day. You should ensure that it is not supposed to be shipped out with special shipping
            methods such as "Signature Required". Signature Required ROs require special handling from the Nintendo Administrator.
            <br> It is not necessary to fill out the Tracking Number field UNLESS the Shipping Code is set to USPS. In this case, you must affix a USPS label to the box, along with a cutout of the consumer's address from the work order. You will also
            have to enter the tracking number from the label into the entry field.:
            <br><img src="./original (old)/writeupworkinstructions_files/addressvalidation.png" alt="RO Validation" style="width:auto;height:100px">
            <br> - Weight should be set to 1 for most boxes, unless there are more than 6 joycons in a particular box. 6 joycons weigh about 1 pound with packing material, so add 1 pound for every six JoyCons.
            <br> - When the form is complete, click the Print Ship Label Button. This will prompt the UPS terminal to print a shipping label for this customer. The address is populated for you. If this is a linked RO and a label was already generated,
            you will be prompted to reuse the label. You can accept this, so that you dont end up with a label for each RO on the box.
            <br> - When the label is printed, verify that theaddress on the shipping label matches the information on the work orders in front of you before affixing it to the top of the box.
            <br><img src="./original (old)/writeupworkinstructions_files/shipping label.jpg" alt="RO Validation" style="width:auto;height:400px">
            <br> - A packing list also is printed automatically. Include this in the completed package, along with a "Post Repair Letter".
            <br> JoyCon-Only ROs have a pre-filled post repair letter.
            <br><img src="./original (old)/writeupworkinstructions_files/packinglist.jpg" alt="RO Validation" style="width:auto;height:400px">
            <br><img src="./original (old)/writeupworkinstructions_files/postrepair.jpg" alt="RO Validation" style="width:auto;height:400px">
            <br> - Click Final Inspection, and await a Success Message. If you receive an error message, process this as a discrepancy.
            <br> - Click Part Usage, and await a Success Message.
            <br><img src="./original (old)/writeupworkinstructions_files/success.png" alt="RO Validation" style="width:auto;height:100%">
            <br> If you receive an error message, process this as a discrepancy. If you do not click BOTH of these buttons before refreshing the page, the order will not be complete, which will cause a failure in the next process.
            <br> -Lastly, remove any work orders, consumer letters, and paperwork from the box. This is private information, and must be placed in the blue bin to be shredded.
            <br><img src="./original (old)/writeupworkinstructions_files/shred bin.jpg" alt="RO Validation" style="width:auto;height:400px">
            <br> Ensure that ALL ROs are complete before moving on to the next one. If there are multiple joycons/work orders, each must be completed individually.
