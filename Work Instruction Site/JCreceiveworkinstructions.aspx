            &#9657; <u>All</u> operators must be wearing gloves.

            <br> &#9657; <u>All</u> operators must follow one piece flow, meaning there is only one repair order on the bench at a time.<br>

            <h2>Data Entry</h2>
            <br>Other than opening, Receiving is the first entry point into our repair process.
            <br>There are a few methods by which you may locate the consumer's order. The easiest and safest way is to search by "ATG Number". Most shipping labels have an ATG number in the reference field, or as a barcode at the bottom:
            <br><img src="img/jcreceive/atgsearch.PNG" alt="ATG SEARCH" style="height:auto;">
            <br>The secondary methods are to search by the consumer's first/last names, or by postal code. You must first select one of these methods in the dropdown box before clicking search.
            <br><span style="color:red"><b>It is imperative that these methods are used as a last resort. You must take extra caution to validate that the name and address are correct in these cases, since you will likely obtain results which are not correct. If you are not sure, it is best practice to ask a lead/supervisor.</b></span>
            <br> When you enter an ATG number and click search, the page will return all results that match the identical consumer information associated with the ATG that you entered. In other words, if a consumer has more than one order, searching by
            ATG will display all of their orders.
            <br><img src="img/jcreceive/searchresult.PNG" alt="Search Results" style="height:auto">
            <ul>
                <br> The results will display the name/address, and main component of each order. You'll need to analyze which is the correct order, and whether there are sufficient orders to proceed.
                <li>
                    <div style="color:red"><b>You may only process 1 joycon per order. If there are not enough orders to match the quantity of joycons in the box, we must label the box "Needs RO" and refrain from receiving it until the additional orders are created. Place these boxes in the designated location to be handled by the administrator.</div>
                </li>
                <li>If there are enough orders, but the color or side of the main component does not match, this is not a discrepancy. We can adjust the order to match what we have received.</li></b>
            </ul>

            If you have the correct number of orders to proceed, you may select an RO to begin the process by clicking "Select". Note that you must perform this process for each individual joycon that you have in the box.
            <br>The "address" field on the form will activate. You must enter the first 4 characters of the consumer's street address in order to validate the order. It is important that you enter the first 4 characters from the <b><u>shipping label</u></b>            before clicking "Validate", not from the result screen. <b><u>Failing to follow these instructions would bypass a critical accuracy check that would result in a significant consumer facing failure, for which you would be directly responsible.</u></b>            If the characters do not match the order you are working on, you will receive a "Manager Approval" message. This must be handled as a discrepancy. Label the box "Address Verification" and place it in the designated location.
            <br><img src="img/jcreceive/validateaddress.PNG" alt="Validate Address" style="height:auto">
            <br>When the address has been validated successfully, you will be prompted to answer two more questions, confirming that you are working on the correct RO#, and that the consumer information is correct. Look once again at the address displayed
            on the screen, and compare it to <b><u>all</u></b> of the paperwork inside of the box. Answer the questions accordingly.
            <br>
            <br>After confirming, fill out the "Other information" section of the form accordingly:
            <ul>
                <li>The opener is responsible for writing their initials. Box Opener Initials should be entered as written on the shipping label.</li>
                <li>Receive Employee should be entered as your initials. This records your information, so that we know you received it.</li>
                <li>Incoming tracking number should be scanned off of the inbound shipping label. This is the bigger of the 2 barcodes on the UPS label, and usually starts with 1Z71757Y.
                    <br><img src="img/jcreceive/upslabel.jpg" alt="UPS Label" style="height:40vh">
                </li>
            </ul>
            Next, the "Condition" section must be filled out. This is mostly done for you, but you occasionally need to answer whether or not a receipt was received with the RO. If there is a receipt in the box, answer Yes. Otherwise, enter No. You may have a receipt
            in the box, but it is irrelevant unless this question is active on the form. In other words- if the form doesn't ask for it, no action needs to be taken. If you answer yes, choose the date on the receipt under the "Purchase Date" section.
            <br>Condition, Serial NO Readable, Serial No, Sister RO are answered automatically, there is no need to modify these answers. When you are ready to proceed, click "Verify" on the right side of the form.
            <br>Next, we must confirm the main component. <b><u>this step is VERY important</u></b>.
            <br>Look at the joycon you are receiving, and determine the color and side you are receiving. Once you have determined the color and side, click edit item, and enter the corresponding Receiving Part Number.
            <br> A reference to each JoyCon and their respective part numbers is available. In terms of color accuracy, it is best viewed on the computer monitor than printed out. This reference will be available at your PC.
            <br> <b>Accuracy at this step is critically important. Failing to receive the correct color and side of each joycon may result in confusion that will continue down the line. 
            <br>Nintendo's computer system, Galaxy, can not accept Receiving Number changes after the fact. If you accidentally receive the incorrect Receiving number, inform a supervisor or team lead immediately. They will show you how to fill out the main component correction form.</b>
            <br><img src="img/jcreceive/maincomp.PNG" alt="Main Component" style="height:auto">
            <ul>
                <li>For each RO we receive, we will need to manually enter the part number of the joycon we are receiving. This must be done PRIOR to clicking "Confirm". Click "edit", and you will be able to adjust the number. Each receiving bench has a component
                    number reference sheet. You must enter this value to match the one which corresponds to the joycon you are receiving. Then, click Update before confirming the main component. If you need help with this, consult a lead, supervisor.</li>
            </ul>
            There is a section below the "Main Component" section, which is not used for JoyCon only ROs. The buttons remain inactive. Scroll down to the bottom of the form.
            <br>There are four "Y/N questions that are answered for you, there is no need to modify these answers except in one rare case:
            <li>if you answered Yes to Receipt Received earlier, you must answer "Yes" to Place on Hold. This will require you to also select "Receipt Received" under Transaction Reason. You will also be prompted for a "Hold Note", in which case you must
                enter the name of the retailer on the receipt, as well as the receipt date once again. These cases are very rare, so be sure that you have not simply answered yes to the Receipt Received question by mistake.</li>
            <br>At the bottom of the form, there is a Notes field. This will be used to enter other descriptive information. If the consumer sends in joycon accessory, such as a wrist strap, case, sticker, analog stick cover, etc., make a note of it here.</b>
            <br>When you have completely and accurately filled out the form, click the "Create Order" button at the bottom. The order will process for a few moments. You should receive a "Success" message. If you receive an error, process the RO as a
            discrepancy, and write the error message down.
            <br> After the success message is displayed, it will be replaced with a Print Label/Work Order button. Press this button to print the RO labels, and the work order.
            <br> The data entry portion of Receiving is now over, but there are a few other things to prepare before sending the box to Triage.
        </p1>
        </div>
        <div class="rightSection" id="preparation">
            <h2>Preparing for Triage</h2>
            <br> Place one of the labels on each side of the box. If the RO is for a left joycon, place the label on the left side of the box. If it is a right joycon, place it on the right side of the box.
            <br> Affix a date sticker to each RO label. You may do this before or after affixing it to the box. Ensure that the stamp is set to the correct date.
            <br><img src="img/jcreceive/labelgun.jpg" alt="Label Gun" style="height:40vh">
            <br> Each day of the week has a corresponding sticker color:
            <ul>
                <li style="background-color: rgba(rgb(30, 255, 0), green, blue, alpha);">Monday - Green</li>
                <li style="background-color: rgba(rgb(235, 79, 18), green, blue, alpha);">Tuesday - Orange</li>
                <li style="background-color: rgba(rgb(250, 1, 237), green, blue, alpha);">Wednesday - Pink</li>
                <li style="background-color: rgba(rgb(255, 208, 0), green, blue, alpha);">Thursday - Yellow</li>
                <li style="background-color: rgba(rgb(255, 255, 255), green, blue, alpha);">Friday - White</li>
            </ul>
            You must also fill out a traveler for each RO you receive, which should be stapled to the corresponding work order that is printed. Fill out the following sections:
            <ul>
                <li>RO Number (located on the RO label and the work order tag)</li>
                <li>Circle left/right joycon accordingly, and note the color on the line. Also compare this to what is on the work order tag to ensure you did not mistakenly receive an incorrect color.</li>
                <li>Note the outbound shipping method (located on the work order tag) by checking the box:
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none;">UPS Ground = UPS</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none;">UPS 2 Day = UPSBLUE</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none;">UPS Next Day Air = UPSRED</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none;">USPS = MAIL</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Re-Work Applicable Left JoyCon Controllers</h3>
            We must also be aware that a small number of left JoyCons exist which require a "ReWork" in order to remedy an early production issue. <b>This issue does not apply to right JoyCons, only Left.</b>
            <br><a href="https://nintendo.sharepoint.com/sites/techsvc/NX/Pages/Referenced_Procedures_JC.aspx#JC" target="_blank">Review the information on sharepoint to determine which JoyCons need a rework.</a>
            <br>
            <br>It may be difficult to see the lot code in some cases, but magnifiers are available to assist with this task.
            <br>If a rework is applicable, affix a pink "Rework" sticker to each side of the RO box.
            <br> Unless you have more ROs to receive for this package/consumer, your job is now complete. Ensure that <u><b>all</b></u> paperwork and items are returned to the box before placing the box on your outgoing cart.
            </p1>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                There are a lot of steps in receiving, but the process moves quickly in practice. The most important things to remember are one piece flow, address verification, and receiving the correct main component.
