        <p1>
            &#9657; <u>All</u> operators must be wearing gloves.
            <br> &#9657; <u>All</u> benches must have scratch protection in the form of either pink foam or the ESD mat.
            <br> &#9657; <u>All</u> operators must follow one piece flow, meaning there is only one repair order on the bench at a time.<br>
            <div style="color:red"><u><b>There are no exceptions to these rules. If there is a preventative, inform a lead or supervisor immediately.</b></u></div>

        <h3>Best Buy ROs</h3>
        <br> Occasionally, we will receive an order on behalf of Best Buy. In these cases, a consumer name and address will not be present in the box. Instead, the first name on the shipping label will be "BestBuy" and the last name will be the Best Buy order number.
    </div>
    <div class="rightSection" id="validate">

            <h3>Best Buy ROs</h3>
        Occasionally, we will receive an order on behalf of Best Buy. 
        <br>In these cases, a consumer name and address may not be present in the box. Best Buy policy dictates that they are not to provide us with the end user's information. That said, it is not uncommon that we do receive a Best Buy order invoice. 
        <br>If there is a Best Buy Invoice in the box, please ensure it does not conflict with the order number referenced on the shipping label.
        <br>Instead, the last name on the shipping label will be "Best Buy" and the first name will be the Best Buy order number.
        <br>It is permitted in these cases to receive this as you would any other order, but by searching the order number as the "First Name" instead of the ATG Number. That said, be certain that any Best Buy orders do not have any extra paperwork that does not match the Best Buy paperwork.
        </p1>
    </div>
    <div class="rightSection" id="dataentry">
        <p1>
            <h2>Data Entry</h2>
            <br>Other than opening, Receiving is the first entry point into our repair process.
            <br>There are a few methods by which you may locate the consumer's order. The easiest and safest way is to search by "ATG Number". Most shipping labels have an ATG number in the reference field, or as a barcode at the bottom:

            <br>The secondary methods are to search by the consumer's first/last names, or by postal code. You must first select one of these methods in the dropdown box before clicking search.
            <br><span style="color:red"><b>It is imperative that these methods are used as a last resort. You must take extra caution to validate that the name and address are correct in these cases, since you will likely obtain results which are not correct. If you are not sure, it is best practice to ask a lead/supervisor.</b></span>
            <br> When you enter an ATG number and click search, the page will return all results that match the identical consumer information associated with the ATG that you entered. In other words, if a consumer has more than one order, searching by
            ATG will display all of their orders.
            <ul>
                <br> The results will display the name/address, serial number, and main component of each order. You'll need to analyze which is the correct order.
                <li>
                    <div style="color:red"><b>Each console must be set up for the correct product line in order to be received successfully. There is a reference at the bench which details the part numbers that correspond to each serial number prefix. If the order is not set up as the correct product line, label the box "IP" and do not proceed. Place these boxes in the designated location to be handled by the administrator.</div>
                <li>If the order is set up as the correct product line, but the main component is for the incorrect color, this is not a discrepancy. We can adjust the order to match what we have received.</li>
                <li>If there are multiple orders, always select the order which references the serial number you have in front of you. It is also acceptable to use an order which has no serial number referenced.</li></b>
            </ul>

            Once you have determined the correct RO, you may select it to begin the process by clicking "Select".
            <br>The "address" field on the form will activate. You must enter the first 4 characters of the consumer's street address in order to validate the order. It is important that you enter the first 4 characters from the <b><u>shipping label</u></b>            before clicking "Validate", not from the result screen. <b><u>Failing to follow these instructions would bypass a critical accuracy check that would result in a significant consumer facing failure, for which you would be directly responsible.</u></b>            If the characters do not match the order you are working on, you will receive a "Manager Approval" message. This must be handled as a discrepancy. Label the box "Address Verification" and place it in the designated location.
            <li>If after validating the address you receive a popup notification that says "SPECIAL HANDLING!", finish the receiving process accordingly, but provide the RO to the Administrator instead of passing it to backup. This is an indicator that the order needs special attention according to Nintendo's CS representative.
            </li><li>If after validating the address you receive a popup notification that says "ASR!", finish the receiving process accordingly, but affix a yellow ASR sticker to the box next to the RO label. Instead of passing it to backup, place it on the designated ASR cart. 
            </li><br>When the address has been validated successfully, you will be prompted to answer two more questions, confirming that you are working on the correct RO#, and that the consumer information is correct. Look once again at the address displayed
            on the screen, and compare it to <b><u>all</u></b> of the paperwork inside of the box. Answer the questions accordingly.
            <br>
            <br>After confirming, fill out the "Other information" section of the form accordingly:
            <ul>
                <li>The opener is responsible for writing their initials. Box Opener Initials should be entered as written on the shipping label.</li>
                <li>Receive Employee should be entered as your initials. This records your information, so that we know you received it.</li>
                <li>Incoming tracking number should be scanned off of the inbound shipping label. This is the bigger of the 2 barcodes on the UPS label, and usually starts with 1Z71757Y.</li>
            </ul>
            Next, the "Condition" section must be filled out:
            <ul>
                <li>If there is a receipt in the box, answer Yes. Otherwise, enter No. You may have a receipt in the box, but it is irrelevant unless this question is active on the form. In other words- if the form doesn't ask for it, no action needs to be
                    taken. If you answer yes, choose the date on the receipt under the "Purchase Date" section.</li>
                <li>Condition - Give a very quick and general indication of the condition of the unit. Most units are Fair. A brand new, perfect unit should be considered "Good", and a unit which is physically damaged, disassembled, or in pieces should be
                    considered "Abused". It is not necessary to scrutinize the unit to make a determination. When in doubt, "Fair" is sufficient.</li>
                <li>Serial No Readable - Should always be yes. Any console which does not have a legible serial number will need to have a label printed.</li>
                <li>Serial No - Scan the serial number of the console into this field.</li>
                <li>Sister RO - You may leave this blank every time. It is no longer necessary.</li>
                <li>When you are ready to proceed, click "Verify" on the right side of the form. If you receive a "Manager Approval" message after this step, you must process this as a discrepancy. Label the box "MA" and place it in the designated location.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>Next, we must confirm the main component. <b><u>This step is VERY important</u></b>. Look at the console, and compare it to the description listed in this section:
            <ul>
                <li>If it is the correct color/edition, and has the correct serial number prefix click "Confirm" to confirm the main item. </li>
                <li>If it is NOT the correct color, we must adjust the main component. This is a very common scenario, so you will need to get comfortable with this process. This must be done PRIOR to clicking "Confirm". Instead, click "edit", and you will
                    be able to adjust the number. Each receiving bench has a component number reference sheet. You much change this value to match the one which corresponds to the console you are receiving. Then, click Update before confirming the main
                    component. If you need help with this, consult a lead, supervisor, or experienced receiver.</li>
                <li>If the item is not the correct product line to correspond with the serial prefix, this cannot be adjusted here. There is reference at the bench which details the part numbers that correspond to each serial number prefix. If the order is
                    not set up as the correct product line, label the box "IP" and do not proceed. Place these boxes in the designated location to be handled by the administrator. </li>
            </ul>
            There is a section below the "Main Component" section, which is used to account for any additional items received with the console. Each button corresponds to a common accessory or JoyCon. Clicking one of the buttons adds it to the list of items received.
            <br>If an item is not listed here, you may search for it by entering a keyword in the entry box and clicking "Search Component". If you know the component number, such as one listed on the supplementary sheet, you may enter it in the same
            box and click "Add Component" instead of "Search Component". Any item which does not have a part number should be entered as Miscellaneous, which has a button of its' own. If you are not sure whether or not an item should have a unique component
            number, don't hesitate to ask an experienced peer, team lead, or supervisor.
            <br>It is important to account for all components received with the console. Failure to do this can cause a signficant consumer facing issue.
            <div style="color:red"><b>Account for all items accurately and thoroughly. Always look inside the game card slot and SD card slot to ensure these items are not missed. If you find an SD card inside the console, place it in a ziploc bag and tape it to top of the inside of the box. Place any loose game cards in a UPS bag affixed to the top of the box. It is your primary responsibility to account for these items.</b></div>

            <br>There are four "Y/N questions that must be answered accordingly:
            <uL>
                <li>If there is an SD card, answer yes to the first question. You must also fill out the "SD Card Information" field with the brand name and capacity of the SD card. If there is no SD card, answer No and leave the field blank.</li>
                <li>The second and third questions should always be "No", as they are not relevant to the Nintendo Switch product lines.</li>
                <li>if you answered Yes to Receipt Received earlier, you must answer "Yes" to Place on Hold. This will require you to also select "Receipt Received" under Transaction Reason. You will also be prompted for a "Hold Note", in which case you must
                    enter the name of the retailer on the receipt, as well as the receipt date once again. These cases are very rare, so be sure that you have not simply answered yes to the Receipt Received question by mistake.</li>
            </uL>
            <br>At the bottom of the form, there is a Notes field. This will be used to enter other descriptive information. If the consumer sends in a miscellaneous accessory, describe it here. Also make a note of any unusual characteristics of the system
            or order, such as if the unit is physically damaged or if there are any stickers or screen protectors on the unit. You can be fairly general here, as it is not your responsibility to catalog every issue with the unit. Merely note the physical/cosmetic
            state of the unit, or if they included anything unusual.</b>
            <br>When you have completely and accurately filled out the form, click the "Create Order" button at the bottom. The order will process for a few moments. You should receive a "Success" message. If you receive an error, process the RO as a
            discrepancy, and write the error message down.
            <br> After the success message is displayed, it will be replaced with a Print Label/Work Order button. Press this button to print the RO labels, and the work order.
            <br> The data entry portion of Receiving is now over, but there are a few other things to prepare before sending the box to Triage.
        </p1>
        </div>
        <div class="rightSection" id="preparation">
            <h2>Preparing for Triage</h2>
            <br> Place one of the labels on each side of the box. If the RO is for a left joycon, place the label on the left side of the box. If it is a right joycon, place it on the right side of the box.
            <br> Affix a date sticker to each RO label. You may do this before or after affixing it to the box. Ensure that the stamp is set to the correct date. Each day of the week has a corresponding sticker color:
            <ul>
                <li>Monday - Green</li>
                <li>Tuesday - Orange</li>
                <li>Wednesday - Pink</li>
                <li>Thursday - Yellow</li>
                <li>Friday - White</li>
            </ul>
            You must also fill out a traveler for the product that you receive (either HAC/HDH), which should be stapled to the corresponding work order that is printed. Fill out the following sections:
            <ul>
                <li>RO Number (located on the RO label and the work order tag></li>
                <li>Note whether or not an SD card was received.</li>
                <li>Note the outbound shipping method (located on the work order tag) by checking the box:
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none;">UPS Ground = UPS</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none;">UPS 2 Day = UPSBLUE</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none;">UPS Next Day Air = UPSRED</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none;">USPS = MAIL</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            Fold the work order with the traveler stapled to it in half before placing it back in the box.

            <br> Unless you have more ROs to receive for this package/consumer, your job is now complete. Ensure that <u><b>all</b></u> paperwork and items are returned to the box before placing the box on your outgoing cart.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                There are a lot of steps in receiving, but the process moves quickly in practice. The most important things to remember are one piece flow, address verification, and receiving the correct main component.
