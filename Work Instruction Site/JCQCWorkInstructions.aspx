            - <u>All</u> operators must be wearing gloves.
            <br> - <u>All</u> benches must have scratch protection in the form of either pink foam or the ESD mat.
            <br> - <u>All</u> operators must follow one piece flow, meaning there is only one repair order on the bench at a time.<br>

            <div style="color:red"><b>If any items do not match completely, are

            <br> - The traveler must be filled out for all preceding positions. QC is the last station to fill out the traveler. Triage and Restore should <b>always</b> be filled out. Repair and Testing may be blank if the unit was exchanged or only accessories
            were repaired/exchanged, but this is the only exception. Any paperwork which is incomplete is an indicator that not all processes were performed, and is considered a failure.

        <h2>QC Process</h2>
        <p1>
            It is QC's responsibility to perform a practical test to ensure that the consumer's reported symptom (CRS) has been resolved. There are a few other routine tests and checks that we perform as well, but this is the primary function of QC. The following
            steps may be performed in no particular order, and the efficiency of the sequence may vary based on symptom. Nevertheless, <b>all</b> of the following steps must be performed before completing QC. Be sure to mark each step as you
            go through the process.
            <h3>Symptom Resolution Verification</h3>
            For all repairs, you must read the work order, and all consumer letters and notes to understand the symptom they asked us to resolve. The testing you must perform to verify the symptom is resolved will vary based upon the reported symptom, but here are
            some example scenarios:
            <br>Read the following procedures to understand how this may be accomplished:

                joycon analog are checked <b>at least 3 times before you may conclude that the symptom is not occurring.</b></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;"><a href="https://nintendo.sharepoint.com/sites/techsvc/NX/Pages/Referenced_Procedures_JC.aspx#buttons" target="_blank">Test Buttons</a>Check each button once before passing the JoyCon.</li>
            <h3>Visual Inspection</h3>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;"><a href="https://nintendo.sharepoint.com/sites/techsvc/NX/Pages/Referenced_Procedures_JC.aspx#visual" target="_blank">Follow these instructions to perform the Visual Inspection.
                <br> <b>Please take care to insure that the rail buttons match the color of the JoyCon Housing. It is possible that the incorrect color could be installed at repair.</b></a></li>
            Check to ensure there are no cracks in the housing, particularly near the "Lock Release" button, as this is a common area for cracks and damage.
            <br><img src="./img/jctriage/crackedhousing.jpg" alt="crackedhousing">
            <br>Also, <b>always</b> ensure that the joycon lock adequately prevents the JoyCon from coming loose from the HAC console without holding the lock release.

    <div class="rightSection" id="cleaning">
        <h2>Cleaning the JoyCon</h2>
        <p1>
            Prior to passing QC, we are required to gently clean/wipe the HAC console with a mixture of alcohol and water AND ammonia-free Windex.
            <ul>
                <li>First, clean the surface of the JoyCon with the alcohol/water mixture using a microfiber towel.
                    <div style="color:red"><b>Do not use excessive alcohol, as this can cause damage to the unit. A single dab on the towel is likely sufficient.</b></div>
                    <img src="./img/jcqc/alcoholdispenser.jpg" alt="Alcohol" style="height:40vh">
                </li>
                <li>Wait for the unit to dry, which should only take a few moments since alcohol quickly evaporates. Alternatively, you can use a <u><b>separate</b></u> dry microfiber towel. </li>
                <li><span style="color:red"><b>Using a separate microfiber towel,</span> wipe the surface of the JoyCon with Ammonia-Free Windex only. Blue windex is not Ammonia-Free, and is not acceptable per Nintendo of America.</b>
                    <br><img src="./img/jcqc/windexaf.jpg" alt="Windex" style="height:40vh"> </li>
                <li>Again, wait for the unit to dry, which should only take a few moments since windex quickly evaporates. Alternatively, you can use a <u><b>separate</b></u> dry microfiber towel. </li>
                <li>Insert the JoyCon into a plastic bag, and tape it shut. Ensure the unit is dry before doing this.
                    <br><img src="img/jcqc/baggedJC.jpg" alt="BaggedJC" style="height:30vh">
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br> If there are more than 2 ROs in a box, affix a numbered sticker to the RO label on the box and its corresponding joycon. The number signifies to the next operator which joycon corresponds to an RO, since we'll be pulling the paperwork
            out after writeup.
            <br><img src="./original (old)/writeupworkinstructions_files/sticker.jpg" alt="RO Validation" style="width:auto;height:400px">
        </p1>
    </div>
    <div class="rightSection" id="failureHandling">
        <p1>
            <h2>Failure Handling</h2>
            Failures in QC will likely result in the JoyCon being swapped. When a true failure occurs, label the joycon with the RO number by writing on a piece of masking tape using a marker. Do not use a pen, as this will scratch the JoyCon. Mark the traveler to
            denote that you are exchanging the JoyCon, and cross out the repair/testing sections to ensure that the intention to exchange the JoyCon is clear. Test all other joycons in the box and handle them accordingly before placing the box in the
            designated location to go to swap.
