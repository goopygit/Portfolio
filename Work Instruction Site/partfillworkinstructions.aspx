            &#9657; <u>All</u> operators must be wearing gloves when handling bare products or parts.
            <br> &#9657; <u>All</u> defective parts must be labeled and stored separately from new, functional parts.
            <br> &#9657; <u>All</u> operators must follow one piece flow, meaning there is only one package on the bench at a time.<br>
            <br> &#9657; When handling any bare static-sensitive parts such as PCBs or sub-PCBs, all ESD Guidelines must be followed including wearing gloves, a grounded wrist strap, and placing the parts inside of static bags.
            <br> &#9657; Bulk Serial Numbers must be destroyed immediately upon expending them.
            <div style="color:red"><u><b>There are no exceptions to these rules. If there is a preventative, inform a lead or supervisor immediately.</b></u></div>

            <h2>Parts Fill (from Window)</h2>
            Most Parts related tasks are handled on <a target="_blank" href="galaxyprd.unitedradio.com/PartUsage">the Part Usage Page.</a> Tasks are primarily split between two responsibilities. Work in the Parts Department is generally coming from two
            sources: Parts ordered face to face at the window, or parts ordered from triage. Attending to the parts window should take generally priority over filling parts orders from triage. That said, window customers are expected to be reasonably
            patient if you are in the middle of a task.
            <br>If a production operator or technician approaches the window, they likely need to order a part from you. At your earliest convenience, attend to them. They are expected to write down the parts that they need on the work order in the form
            of a "Part Number". The part number specifically references an inventoried part.
            <br>The part numbers need to be assigned to the RO via <a target="_blank" href="galaxyprd.unitedradio.com/PartUsage">the Part Usage Page.</a>
            <br> &#9657; Enter the RO Number into the corresponding field in the Part Usage form, and click confirm. <br>
            <br> You must enter the part number, the quantity that you are assigning, and your initials.<br>
            <br> &#9657; When the form is filled out, click add part. It should populate the list with the part you added. If the operator needs more than one part, you may repeat this process as needed.
            <li>PCBs have serial numbers, but they are not a "serialized part". In other words, do not enter the serial number until <b>after</b>clicking the add button, otherwise it will produce an error that the serial number is invalid or doesn't exist.
                Until then, leave the serial number field blank.</li>
            <li>If a PCB is added to an RO, you will be prompted to enter the outbound serial number of the PCB. This is a label that is taped to the replacement PCB, so you will need to retrieve it before assigning it to the RO. You are to keep the large
                barcode label, and destroy it. Give the smaller barcode to the technician to be placed on the installed unit.</li>
            <li>Never assign a PCB without first taking back the old PCB, which should be labeled with the RO number and damaged. It will come to you in two pieces. These are stored in their own separate defective location.</li>
            <br> Press CTRL+P or to print the part usage page. A prompt will appear, but you only need to confirm that you want to print the page.
            <br> &#9657; After printing the pick slip, click Save Part Usage, and click Yes to confirm.<br>
            <br> &#9657; The Part Usage page will automatically refresh after you have saved your changes. Always ensure that you have completed this process before moving on to another task.<br>
            <br> If a part number is mistakenly assigned to an RO, you may remove it by clicking the red X next to the part number. Note that your initials must be entered before this will function.
            <br> After assigning the parts to the RO, you must physically retrieve them before returning the work order and parts to the operator. Carefully ensure that you have retrieved each part completely and accurately, and remember to follow the
            handling guidelines.
            <br> if you are unsure where to locate a part, enter the part number into <a target="_blank" href="galaxyprd.unitedradio.com/PartLookup">the Part Lookup Page.</a> When you click "Search", the location of the parts, as well as the on-hand quantity
            will be displayed. The locations listed here correspond to a shelf or warehouse location which will be labeled accordingly. This tool is useful for helping locate parts you are not familiar with. You may also search for parts by description
            if you are unsure of the part number by instead entering a keyword in all capitals into the Part Number box before clicking "Search Part". This will return similar results and may be useful in identifying a particular part number.
            <br> Sometimes, an operator will bring a defective accessory with them to be recycled. All street-value accessories must have a core returned before assigning a new one to the RO, unless otherwise instructed by a lead or supervisor. The item
            must be labeled with the RO to indicate it is defective, or damaged by way of cutting the cable. Place the defective part in the appropriate defective parts storage before assigning a replacement to the RO and providing it to the operator.

            <h2>Parts Fill (from Triage)</h2>
            Parts fill orders coming from triage will generally have parts assigned to the ROs already. The exception to this rule will be for serialized unit exchanges, which we will cover separately.
            <br> Begin by again navigating to the Part Usage page.
            <br> Enter the RO of the box which you are looking to fill parts for. You should see that parts are already assigned to the order. Press CTRL+P to print the pick slip. Verify that the RO of the pick slip matches the RO of the box you are handling,
            as it is possible a pickslip has been left behind or mismatched.
            <br> At this point, you only need to retrieve the parts which are already assigned. When filling orders from triage, there is generally no need to add or remove parts. If parts are missing, or you suspect they may be incorrect, ask a lead
            or supervisor to help you. It is possible that the triage operator has mistakenly omitted parts, or assigned one incorrectly. Carefully ensure that you have retrieved each part completely and accurately, and remember to follow the handling
            guidelines before moving on to handle another box.
            <br>Note that a PCB or Swap should never be assigned to an RO outside of the parts department, and should not be filled without a core return.
        </p1>
    </div>
    <div class="rightSection" id="Serialized Swaps">
        <p1>
            <h2>Serialized Swaps</h2>
            Swap orders may come from triage, or from repair technicians. It is important to understand where the swap order is coming from in order to know how to handle it. There should be some indication on the top of the box that the unit is being swapped.
            <br> Inspect the work order traveler to determine the source of the swap:
            <li>If there are initials and writing in the repair section of the traveler, the swap order is coming from repair. For these orders, you must return any parts which are left in the box. If the parts are not present, do not remove them from the
                order. It is a safe presumption that they have been installed already.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the order is coming from triage. There may be nothing on the part usage, or there may be an additional accessory item which may be filled </li>
            <br>Ensure that the core unit is labeled with the RO number, and store it with the defective swap cores. These are separate from PCBs, JoyCon swaps, or generic defective accessories. They will be inventoried and returned to NOA for refurbishing.
            <br>Retrieve the new console from stock, as you will need the serial number before you can assign the item to the RO.
            <br>Begin by adding the part number for the console you are exchanging. Take care not to exchange a HAC console for a HAD, as these are easily confused. The part usage form will produce an error if you attempt to exchange one for the other.
            <br>Unlike a PCB, we must add the serial number to the part usage form <b>before and after</b> clicking add. You will have to enter it in the part usage form, as well as the prompt that appears afterward. If the serial number is not valid
            or does not exist in the database, the form will produce an error. Bring this to the attention of the parts supervisor.
            <br>Enter the quantity and your initials as you always have, and click add.
            <br>Just as with a PCB, you are prompted to enter the outbound serial number. Do so accordingly, and click update.
            <br>Print the part usage slip, as this will be used by the operators to ensure they have the correct unit for the RO.
            <br> &#9657; After printing the pick slip, click Save Part Usage, and click Yes to confirm.<br>
            <br> &#9657; The Part Usage page will automatically refresh after you have saved your changes. Always ensure that you have completed this process before moving on to another task.<br>
