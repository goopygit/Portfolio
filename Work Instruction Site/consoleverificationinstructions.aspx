            <h2>Precautions</h2>
            &#9657; <u>All</u> operators must be wearing gloves.
            <br> &#9657; <u>All</u> benches must have scratch protection in the form of either pink foam or the ESD mat.
            <br> &#9657; <u>All</u> operators must follow one piece flow, meaning there is only one repair order on the bench at a time. In verification, you are the last operator to handle the order before shipment, and you are performing the final quality
            check.
            <br> &#9657; <u>All</u> test equipment including AC adapters, USB cables must be checked daily for damage. Any damaged or dysfunctional test equipment must be reported to a supervisor or team lead.<br>
            <div style="color:red"><u><b>There are no exceptions to these rules. If there is a preventative, inform a lead or supervisor immediately.</b></u></div>

    <div class="rightSection" id="dataentry">

            <h2>Data Entry</h2>
            Verification is performed primarily using the <a href="galaxyprd.unitedradio.com/VerificationNew"> Verification page.</a>
            <br>The Verification process is fast, repetitive, and follows a very specific routine. There are no work orders or travelers to read or fill out when performing the Verification process. This is done intentionally, so that your answers are
            compared to information in the database to ensure that process errors will not result in us shipping incorrect items to consumers with incorrect information. The page will only prompt for the information you need to enter. There are other
            questions on the page, but not all will require an answer every time.
            <br>Each RO on the box must go through the entire verification process individually. If there are multiple ROs in a box, you must complete verification for every RO in the box before moving on.
            <br>Begin by scanning one of the ROs on the box into the "RO Number" box. Press Enter or click "Look Up RO#" to proceed.
            <br>The cursor moves to the next question you must answer. The next step will be to enter the first 4 characters of the consumer's address. This is found on the top of the box on the shipping label. Press Enter or Tab, or click out of the
            entry field to proceed.
            <br>Next, scan the tracking number on the box. Be sure not to confuse this with the smaller barcode on the label, which is not used at our facility. The cursor will automatically proceed to the next question.
            <br>Now, you must scan the serial number from the label on the console.
            <br>In order to answer the "Internal Serial Number" and "Battery Lot Number" questions, you must insert the "Self-Test" card into the console, and power it on. If the unit is already on when the card is inserted, you may receive an error.
            This can be resolved by restarting the console.
            <br>The Internal Serial Number is the QR code displayed on the left side of test screen. Block the other barcode before scanning the correct one in order to prevent erroneous entry.
            <br>The Battery Lot Number is the QR code displayed on the right side of test screen. Block the other barcode before scanning the correct one in order to prevent erroneous entry.
            <br>You will see that the cursor moves all the way down to the bottom, and a number of buttons appear. Each button corresponds to an accessory in the box. All of the common HAC accessories and joycons are listed here, but most game cards are
            not. There is a supplementary sheet of component numbers available at every bench. You are required to enter every component that you find in the box, excluding the console itself. In other words, if there is a dock, left gray joycon, right
            gray joycon in the box in addition to the main console, you must add each these three items before proceeding.
            <br>If an item is not listed here, you may search for it by entering a keyword in the entry box and clicking "Search Component". If you know the component number, such as one listed on the supplementary sheet, you may enter it in the same
            box and click "Add Component" instead of "Search Component". Any item which does not have a part number should be entered as Miscellaneous, which has a button of its' own. If you are not sure whether or not an item should have a unique component
            number, don't hesitate to ask an experienced peer, team lead, or supervisor.
            <div style="color:red"><b>Check for an SD card every time you enter components. If there is one present, it will be located inside of the unit.  </b> </div>
            <br> When you have added ALL of the components in the box, click "Verify Components".
            <br> Provided you have chosen the correct corresponding component, and there is no underlying failure, the form will prompt you to enter a Nickname. To get the Nickname, power on the unit with no test card present, so that you boot into the
            typical system menu. From the main menu, select the user profile in the upper left of the screen. They may have more than one user, but we are primarily concerned with the left-most profile. Enter the Nickname exactly as it is shown on the
            unit, but exclude "'s Profile'". If a character in the nickname cannot be entered on the keyboard, such as a star symbol, enter a '?' in place of the character. If the unit boots up to a white screen which asks you select a language, or a
            white screen that displays an animation prompting you to attach a set of joycons, enter the RO as the nickname.
            <br> The form will prompt you to answer "Is there an SD Card?". You have already accounted for this in the components, but indicate Yes or No. accordingly.
            <br> Next, enter your initials.
            <br> After your initials are entered, a button at the bottom of the form will appear that is labeled "Complete Verification". Click this button to complete the form. A popup message will confirm this, and another button will appear.
            <br> The next button that appears is labeled "Ready to Ship". Clicking this button will result in a short processing delay, followed by a popup message confirming the tranmission was successful. If you receive an error, this may be something
            to bring to the attention of your team lead or supervisor.
            <br> If a message appears that states "Invalid RO status transition from Ready to Ship to Ready to Ship", this is not a legitimate error. It is likely caused by double-clicking the button quickly, and may be ignored.
            <br> After "Ready to Ship" has been successfully sent, a button labeled "Shipped" will appear. Again, click the button and await the "Success" popup. If an error appears at this stage, it is likely legitimate and needs to be processed as a
            discrepancy.
            <br> After "Shipped" is successfully sent, the verification process is completed. If you neglect to click all three of the buttons (verification complete, ready to ship, shipped), the order will not be closed and it will be as though the work
            was not performed. Be sure to always remember to click each button before moving on to the next RO.
            <br> If each RO in a box has been completed, we must prepare the order for shipment.

    <div class="rightSection" id="preshipment">
        <p1>
            <h2>Pre-Shipment</h2>
            <br>All consoles must be shipped out inside of a clear plastic bag, as well as a foam bag. When you have completed verification, package the console accordingly. It is the verifier's responsibility to include a yellow "HAC Notice" before sending
            the package to the warehouse for shipping.
            <br>Once the console has been packaged appropriately, a HAC Notice is included, and verification is complete for ALL ROs, the order is fully complete and ready to be placed with outgoing work.

    </div>
    <div class="rightSection" id="Discrepancies">
        <p1>
            <h2>Discrepancies/Failures</h2>
            If you encounter a "Manager Approval" message during Verification, this is an indicator of one of two scenarios. Either:
            <li>You have made a mistake in your entry,</li>
            or
            <li>You have correctly entered the information, but it does not match what the database expects.</li>

            <br>If you are certain that you have made a mistake in entry, such as accidentally clicking a Blue JoyCon when you have a Gray, it is acceptable to start over from the beginning and enter the correct information.leftCard
            <div style="color:red"><b> If you have entered the information correctly as you have the item in front of you and the failure is occurring anyway, this RO <b><u>MUST</u></b> be processed as a discrepancy.</b>
            </div>
            <div style="color:red"><b>Never assume that you know what is wrong with the RO, and never use "the process of elimination" to get through the form. It is imperative to remember that your role is to fail things in verification if need be, not pass them in spite of the issues. Failing to do this is to blatantly disregard our quality standards, and is likely to cause a serious consumer-facing problem, for which you would be directly responsible.</b></div>
            <br>If you encounter a true failure/discrepancy, write down the step of the form that you last entered before the RO displayed the "Manager Approval" message on a piece of masking tape and affix it to the top of the box. Please also write
            down the RO number you were processing, as there may be several ROs in the box. Place the discrepancy in the designated location, do NOT place it with your outgoing completed work.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            Verification is a relatively simple process once you are accustomed to it, but it is very important. As the final quality check, it is imperative that you are diligent about failing things when they are not correct. The process is designed to help you
            identify failures. This concludes the JoyCon Verification work instructions.
