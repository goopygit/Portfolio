            <h2>Overview</h2>
            Repair/Assembly is very much a "hands-on" position. As such, we won't cover every detail of assembly here. That said, there are many handling guidelines and precautions that are essential to this position.
            <br> When performing the responsibilities of the job, all of these handling guidelines <b>must be followed.</b>
            <br> We'll begin by going over these guidelines, and then go over the general expectations of you as a repair technician.

            <h2>Validate All Information / Components</h2>

            <div style="color:red"><b>The operator should validate <u><i>all</i></u> information.</b></div>
            <br> - The RO on the box label should match the work order in the box.

            <div style="color:red"><b>If any items do not match completely, are
                missing, or have duplicates, this is a failure and must be processed as a discrepancy.</b></div><br>

            <h2>Precautions</h2>
            - <u>All</u> operators must be wearing gloves.
            <br> - <u>All</u> benches must have scratch protection in the form of either pink foam or the ESD mat.
            <br> - <u>All</u> operators must follow one piece flow, meaning there is only one repair order on the bench at a time.
            <div style="color:red"><u><b>Never work on two units at a time, and never have two units disassembled at the same time.</b></u></div>
            <br> - Any damaged or dysfunctional test equipment must be reported to a supervisor or team lead.<br>
            <div style="color:red"><u><b>There are no exceptions to these rules. If there is a preventative, inform a lead or supervisor immediately.</b></u></div>

            <h2>Repair Process Guidelines</h2>
            <br> The traveler reads from left to right, and you are meant to replace the parts designated in the "Triage" column. A few steps that you are required to perform for each part that you replace are detailed in the repair column.
            <br> You only need to perform the steps that correspond to each part that you replace.
            <br> All parts which were assigned at Triage should be at the repair bench. For JoyCons, rails and analogs are self-serve. You must retrieve the correct part that triage has indicated on the traveler before installing it.
            <br> Some parts, such as foam sheets and screws, are signed out in bulk via the "Bench Stock form". Fill out one form for each part number you need. The quantity for screws may need to be determined by the parts department attendant, depending
            on how they are packaged. All other parts must be assigned to the specific RO for which they are being installed.
            <br> Always follow correct torque values for screw installation. This is critically important and you will be audited to ensure you are following it.
            <ul>
                <li>Yellow Torque Driver - Set to .45 - Used for the analog, battery holder, and rail assembly.</li>
                <li>Digital Torque Driver - Set to 1.0 - Used for the 4 Y-bit screws in the Lower Housing </li>
            </ul>
            <br> Never use metal tools in handling electronic components such as printed circuits or flexible cables.
            <br> Always disconnect the battery before removing other parts, and connect it at the latest possible point to prevent electrical damage to internal components.
            <br> Review the handling precautions in <a href="https://nintendo.sharepoint.com/sites/techsvc/NX/Shared%20Documents/HAC-62-0033-001.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Section 5 of this document.</a>
            <br> Whenever you have disassembled a joycon, write a large "B" on the traveler. This can be written in any empty space to the right side of the traveler, or in the empty testing column in the center of the work order.
            <br><img src="img/jcrepair/repaircolumn.jpg" alt="B on Traveler" style="height:40vh">
            <br> Before proceeding, also indicate that you have replaced the parts requested by triage. It is necessary to write the original analog lot # for <u><b>every joycon</b></u> on the traveler. The location of this is noted in the aforementioned
            handling precautions.
            <br> You should rarely, if ever, have extra parts, but if a part is not needed for some reason, <b>it must be returned to the parts department before passing the unit on.</b>
            <li>Sometimes, you may have to swap a joycon if you notice damage which is beyond repair. This includes scenarios such as liquid damage, housing cracks, internal damage, etc. These things will prompt us to exchange the joycon. If you need to exchange
                a joycon label the joycon with the RO number by writing on a piece of masking tape using a marker. Do not use a pen, as this will scratch the JoyCon. Mark the traveler to denote that you are exchanging the JoyCon, and cross out the repair/testing
                sections to ensure that the intention to exchange the JoyCon is clear. Bring the JoyCon to the parts attendant to exchange the JoyCon. Repair all other joycons in the box and handle them accordingly before sending them to testing.

            <h2>Defective Part Handling</h2>
            -All defective parts must be marked with a red marker <b>prior to being removed from the unit.</b>
            <br> - All defective parts must be marked as defective and stored separately from good parts. This means that defective parts must <b>never be stored on the bench.</b> There are red bins at each bench which are specifically designated for
            defective parts.
            <br> -Only <b>new</b> screws may be installed in exterior components of the console. Old screws must be stored separately from new screws.

    <div class="rightSection " id="analogid">
        <p1>
            <h2>Analog Lot Number</h2>
            -Follow the instructions detailed <a href="https://nintendo.sharepoint.com/sites/techsvc/NX/Pages/Repair_Actions_JC.aspx#analog " target="_blank ">on sharepoint</a> to identify the lot number of the analog module.
            <br> This <u>must</u> be noted on the traveler, as the information is required to perform testing and calibration.
            <br> Neglecting to do this will result in a failure in testing.
        </p1>
    </div>
    <div class="rightSection " id="ESD">
        <p1>
            <h2>ESD Handling Precautions</h2>
            <br> - Always follow correct ESD Handling procedures to prevent damage to sensitive internal components. There are absolutely no exceptions to these guidelines. <span style="color:red
                    "><b>The wrist strap must be worn at all times, and it must be plugged in to the ESD monitor. Do not use the "GUEST " side, as this circumvents the monitoring functionality. The wrist strap must be worn when you are at the repair bench.</b></span>
            <div style="color:red "><b>If you find that your ESD monitor is constantly beeping, this likely means that your wrist strap is loose. All lights on the ESD monitor must be green when the wrist strap is being worn.</b></div>
            <br> -The ESD Monitor may beep while the AC Adapter is plugged in to the console you are holding. This is not abnormal, since the AC adaptor is not grounded. For this reason, <span style="color:red "><b><u>you must never test or plug the console in while the unit is disassembled. At a minimum, the unit must be assembled in order to prevent static damage to the console.</u></b></span>
            <br> -The humidifier must be running at all times. If you are experiencing issues with the humidifier, notify a lead/supervisor immediately. Often, issues with leaking/vapor not dispensing can be resolved by emptying the humidifier, drying
            it out, and refilling it. These issues are often prompted a fluctuation in pressure usually caused by the humidifier tipping over, the bottle being loose, or there being simply too much water in the reservoir.
            <br> -When you are carrying a disassembled unit away from the grounded workstation, you must carry the unit and all loose electronic parts inside of NOA-approved static-safe containers such as the cardboard box, or ESD bags.
            <br>Nintendo's complete ESD guidelines are outlined <a href="https://nintendo.sharepoint.com/sites/techsvc/NX/Shared%20Documents/HAC-62-0033-001.pdf#page=8 " target="_blank ">here.</a>
